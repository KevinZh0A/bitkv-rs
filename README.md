## Introduction

Bitkv is a high-performance key-value storage system written in Rust. It leverages a log-structured design with an append-only write approach to deliver exceptional speed, reliability, and scalability.

### Features

- **Efficient Key-Value Storage:** Optimized for fast read and write operations with minimal overhead.
- **Diverse Index:** Support BTree, Skiplist, BPlusTree index for multiple index strategies.
- **MemMap files for efficient I/O:**  For fast index reconstruction adn quick startup times
- **Low latency per item read or written:**
    - Write latency:  `~ 7 Âµs`
    - Read latency:  `~ 3 ns`
- **Concurrency Support:**   fine-grained locking minimizes contentions.
- **WriteBatch transaction:**   commit a batch of write enhance isolation.


## Installation

To use bitkv in your project, add it as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  bitkv = "0.2.1"
  ```
Then, run cargo build to download and compile bitkv-rs and its dependencies.

For more detailed setup and compilation instructions, visit the Bitkv-rs GitHub repository.

## Usages
Please see [`examples`].

For detailed usage and API documentation, refer to the [bitkv-rs Documentation](https://docs.rs/bitkv-rs).

## Introduction

bitkv-rs is a high-performance key-value storage system base in rust, featuring a log-structured filesystem and append-only write approach strategy. Leveraging the Rust's powerful type system and concurrency control model, bitkv-rs offers both safety and speed for data storage operations. Designed with scalability in mind, it supports efficient data retrieval and storage across multiple crates, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to large-scale, distributed data stores.

## Features

- **Efficient Key-Value Storage:** Optimized for fast read and write operations with minimal overhead.

- **Low latency per item read or written:**  
    - Write latency:  `~ 7 Âµs` 
    - Read latency:  `~ 3 ns`

- **Type Safety:** Utilizes Rust's strong typing to ensure data integrity.
- 
- **Concurrency Support:**  fine-grained locking strategy minimizes contentions and ensures atomicity.

## Installation

To use bitkv in your project, add it as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  bitkv = "0.2.1"
  ```
Then, run cargo build to download and compile bitkv-rs and its dependencies.

For more detailed setup and compilation instructions, visit the Bitkv-rs GitHub repository.

## Usages
Please see [`examples`].

For detailed usage and API documentation, refer to the [bitkv-rs Documentation](https://docs.rs/bitkv-rs).
